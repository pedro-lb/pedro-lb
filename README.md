# Hi there! 👋

How are you doing? =)

👉 Currently, I'm working as a Tech Lead at [GeekHunter Brasil](https://www.geekhunter.com.br/).

👉 I'm studying React ⚛️, React Native 📱, GraphQL 🚀 and Elixir 💧.

## 🌱 On knowledge

I try to learn as much as possible from open-source projects, initiatives, and any other source of knowledge. 

Life is very complex, but we might as well learn as much as we can, right?

## 🗿 On projects & personal values

I believe technology can change people's lives, and open source projects are at the core of that. 

Thus, I am focused on creating & shipping projects that help on real-world issues, making the difference.

## ☕ Let's talk!
