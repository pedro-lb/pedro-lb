# Hi there! 👋

How are you doing? =)

👉 Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer at [Constructor.io](https://constructor.io/).

👉 Most of the time, I'm coding with React ⚛️, React Native 📱, GraphQL 🚀 and Elixir 💧.

## 🌱 On knowledge

I try to learn as much as possible from each problem that I eventually solve.

Life is very complex - but we might as well learn as much as we can, right?

## 🗿 On projects & personal values

I believe technology can change people's lives.

Thus, I am focused on creating & shipping products that help on real-world issues, making the difference.

## ☕ Let's talk!

Shoot me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedrobini/) or [email](mailto:dev.pedrobini@gmail.com) on any of the following topics below!

- Programming stuff
- Movies, music, and books
